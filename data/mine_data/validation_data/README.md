## Mine Data - Validated Data

This folder contains the validated address data for mine locations across the United States. To obtain this data, I manually imported data into Geoapify (https://www.geoapify.com/tools/geocoding-online/). Geoapify is only able to process 500 addresses at a time. Each file contains a confidence interval for geocoded values as well as lots of other metadata from this geocoding process.
